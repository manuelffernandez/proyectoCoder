# Final project of the Web Developer course by Coderhouse 

## About this site :globe_with_meridians:

### Centro de ski Lhotse :snowboarder:
This is a fictional ski resort static website that implements HTML, CSS&SCSS and Bootstrap as a Framework.

Some topics to remark:
* The brand identity (name, logo and color palette) were created by me.

* This site has 6 pages: index, galery, location, work, state and notReady. The objective of notReady is to inform the user that the page he wants to visit is currently on "develope". The other pages fulfill their corresponding theme.

* Inside the repo you can find two PDF documents. One of them explains the changes made in the proyect during one of the pre-submit stages to improve the SEO of the site. The other one is a budget based on the delivery-times and design of the proyect.
